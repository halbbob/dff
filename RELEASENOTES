Release Notes 
=============

Detailed description of changes is available in the CHANGES.current and
CHANGES files. The summary below contains just a brief overview of the changes
made in each release.

DFF-1.1.0 summary:

Features: 
---------

* Translation : DFF GUI is now available in chinese, thanks to Zhang Jun.
		Other languages were updated : Deutch, Italian, ...

* AFF : A connector to support AFF dump. The module is based on AFFLib by Simson
L. Garfinkel (http://afflib.org)

* PFF : This module parses PST, OST and PAB files to extract mailbox contents, it
also recovers deleted and orphaned files and give access to unallocated clusters.
It's based on Joachim Metz LibPFF. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpff)


* API : New cache system for FileMapping and File Descriptor.
	vtime now can directly convert unix and windows 64 bits time stamp.

* FAT:
  ** extended attributes:
     ** when there is slack space, a dedicated attribute specifies its start 
     	offset and its size. 
     	This feature is only available for classical files (neither deleted nor
	orphaned)
     ** classical attributes are provided: Read Only, Hidden, System, Archive,
     	Volume
     ** DOS name is provided (8+3 name)
  ** Orphaned files scan
     ** The algorithm is now faster. When walking on free clusters, checks are
     	done to know if it was previously parsed when walking on deleted files
	and directories in allocated clusters. Since chain of clusters of deleted
	directories are used, this pass could read and parse free clusters.

* GUI: Unicode support


Bug fixes:
----------

* Add devices and Add files on Windows, it was not possible to add devices and
files or directories in the same session.

* MFSO opened only one file descriptor and cache it, leading to crash especially
 using device module on windows platform, a totally new cache system was written
for FileMapping and File Descriptor.

* EWF : Sometimes the modules could not open the underlaying due to bad fd
handling this was fixed by using variant.

* FAT :
  ** Recovery of deleted files was not properly handled. Previous version relied
     on the chain of clusters found in FAT which are often emptied when files are
     deleted. Now, the module gets the first cluster, asks the FAT for a the 
     chain of cluster, if the size of all provided is smaller than the size of 
     file, the mapping starts from the first cluster until size of the file is 
     reached.
  ** Even if not noticeable by users (hashes of files were coherent for example)
     and not really a bug, the previous mapping for files were cluster aligned.
     It means the slack space of files were directly included in the mapping.
     This was done this way in prediction of future implementation of MFSO. 
     This feature would be able to read either original size or slack space.
     Since it is not implemented yet, the mapping is now fully based on the size
     of the file. This patch has been developed based on Johannes Stuttgen's
     feedback when he was working on the aff4 module.

* NTFS :

* GUI :

  ** A bug occuring when trying to input a Node as a parameter to modules has
     been fixed : it was not possible to browse in the tree view.

  ** The tree view, in the node browser, had an inconsitant behavior : to change
     directories, users had to double-click on nodes names, which used to
     collapse the tree view. This is fixed. The node browser now behaves as a
     classic file browser.

* Variant vtime repr:
  ** Dealing with vtime encapsulated in Variant in the Python interpreter, an
     exception were raised because there were no __repr__ or __str__ provided
     for this type.
